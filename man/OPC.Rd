\title{Calculate orientation patch count of a surface}
\usage{
OPC(plyFile, rotation = 0, minimum_faces = 3, minimum_area = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{plyFile}{An object of classes "mesh3d" and "shape3d" with
calculated normals}

\item{rotation}{Rotates the file in degrees about the center vertical
axis}

\item{minimum_faces}{Minimum number of ply faces required
for a patch to be counted towards the total patch count}

\item{minimum_area}{Minimual percentage of total surface area a
patch must occupy to be counted towards the total patch count}
}
\description{
A function that bins patches of a mesh surface that share general orientation and
sums the number of unique patches given certain parameters Modified into
3D from the original 2.5D method described by Evans et al. (2007) High-level
similarity of dentitions in carnivorans and rodents.Nature 445:78-81 doi: 10.1038
nature05433
}
\details{
The function requires a mesh object created by reading in a ply file utilizing
 either the read.ply, vcgPlyread, or read.AVIZO.ply function

Orientation patch count is calculated on meshes that represent specimen surfaces
and have already been downsampled to 10,000 faces and pre-smoothed in a 3D
data editing program. Alignment of the point cloud will have a large effect on patch
orientation and must be done in a 3D data editing program such as Avizo, or using
the R package {auto3dgm} prior to creating and reading in the ply file. The
occlusal surface of the specimen must be made parallel to the X- and Y-axes and
perpendicular to the Z-axis.

The default for minimum_faces is to ignore patches consisting of only a single face
on the mesh. Changing the minimum_area value will disable minimum_faces.
